# LINFO2252: Smart Medical Appointment Manager (Group 07)

The error logs are available at app.log

We have a few inconsistencies in logs, the steps required to reproduce them listed in the path available in the project repository. Run the testing tool to find out exactly at what point.

No errors were found due to transitions between features.

The reason why there are incensistencies is that the feature model in features.txt does not allow contraints to be enforced properly, leading to some features not being activated when the testing tool expects them to be.
